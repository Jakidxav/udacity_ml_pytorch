Welcome to this repository! I completed this project as part of Udacity's [Intro to Machine Learning with PyTorch](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning-nanodegree--nd229) Nanodegree program. 

In this repository, you will find two Jupyter Notebooks and a helper methods file. `arvato_data_cleaning.ipynb` describes the pre-processing and data cleaning tasks that I performed on data from Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics. The data cannot be shared because of a privacy agreement, but I have tried to document all of my steps so that it is easy to follow along without it.

The second Notebook, `arvato_pca_clustering.ipynb` shows how Principal Component Analysis can be used for dimensionality reduction on large datasets. Afterwards, I cluster groups of customers together using sklearn's KMeans package and interpret the results as if I were presenting to a group of stake holders.

The Jupyter Notebooks in this repository run on the most up to date versions of the following packages:
- NumPy
- pandas
- seaborn
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- pickle
